# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the assignment is to utilize the skills we learned in excel to help Louise find out more information about the campaign goals of other theater plays. Additionally, we want to present a story using visualization methods based on the kickstarter data provided through line charts.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The first challenge that I encountered invovled splitting out the date conversion into months on the pivot table. However, found out I can right click on the date in the pivot table and group it into month instead of year and day. 
- The second challenge involved setting up the countifs statement, but found out I needed adjust my initial formula. My error was stemming from the goal dollar amount range in the formula. I had to add criterias for the ranges such as ">=1000" and "<=4999"

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
